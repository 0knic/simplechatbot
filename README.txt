-It first asks for your name, and prints it in a println statement.
-It guesses your age by having you input the remainders of your age divided by certain numbers
-It counts to any integer of your choice in java's range
-It gives you a multiple choice question about methods

NOTES:
  - The multiple choice quiz is the only part where it detects if a proper
    answer is written (like an int instead of a string), the rest of the
    questions will return an error if a type other than int is inputed.
